        <h1>Introduction to SQL</h1>
        <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is used to perform various operations on the data stored in databases, such as querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data.</p>
        <p>SQL is widely used in various applications, from web development to data analysis, due to its powerful capabilities and ease of use. Some of the key features of SQL include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Querying: Retrieve specific data from one or more tables.</li>
            <li>Data Manipulation: Insert, update, and delete data in tables.</li>
            <li>Data Definition: Create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.</li>
            <li>Data Control: Control access to data and ensure data integrity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, SQL is an essential tool for anyone working with relational databases, providing a standardized way to interact with and manage data efficiently.</p>
